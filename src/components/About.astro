            Junior at UW-Madison majoring in Computer Science and Mathematics. My hobbies include coding, reading, guitar (electric and classical), chess, volunteering, and video games.
            I love backend development but I dabble in full stack from time to time.
            I also love cats.

          <p class="leading-relaxed text-left text-lg mb-6"> Born and raised in Overland Park, KS.
            My passion for programming began about two years back after taking a software development and game design course in high school.

          <p class="leading-relaxed text-left text-lg mb-6"> 
            Currently, I have been trying to broaden my horizons by learning more front-end dev as well as furthering my interests in systems programming.
